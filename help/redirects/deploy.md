# Deployment using FAKE

**Note: Fake.Deploy is no longer part of FAKE 5 and is considered obsolete and fully replaced by modern deployment systems (puppet, chef, PowerShell DSC, ...). [Announcement](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/issues/1820)
**Tipp: You can still use fake scripts on those alternative deployment systems. Just download the fake binaries and run your scripts.

This page moved to:

- Not yet migrated to FAKE 5
