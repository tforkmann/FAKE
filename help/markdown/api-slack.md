In this article you will learn how to create a [Slack](https://slack.com) webhook integration and send a notification to it. This article assumes that you already have a Slack team setup.

[API-Reference](apidocs/v5/fake-api-slack.html)

## Adding a Webhook Integration to a Channel

Follow the [instructions](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) for setting up an incoming webhook integration. When finished, you should have a Webhook URL that looks like "https://hooks.slack.com/services/some/random/text".

## Sending a Notification to the Webhook

```fsharp
open Fake.Api

// The webhook URL from the integration you set up
let webhookUrl = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/some/random/text"

Slack.sendNotification webhookUrl (fun p ->
    {p with
        Text = "My Slack Notification!\n<https://google.com|Click Here>!"
        Channel = "@SomeoneImportant"
        IconEmoji = ":ghost:"
        Attachments = [| 
            {Slack.NotificationAttachmentDefaults with
                Fallback = "Attachment Plain"
                Text = "Attachment Rich"
                Pretext = "Attachment Pretext"
                Color = "danger"
                Fields = [|
                    {Slack.NotificationAttachmentFieldDefaults with
                        Title = "Field Title 1"
                        Value = "Field Value 2"}
                    {Slack.NotificationAttachmentFieldDefaults with
                        Title = "Field Title 1"
                        Value = "Field Value 2"}|]
            }
            {Slack.NotificationAttachmentDefaults with
                Fallback = "Attachment 2 Plain"
                Text = "Attachment 2 Rich"
                Pretext = "Attachment 2 Pretext"
                Color = "#FFCCDD"
            }|]
    })
|> printfn "Result: %s"
```

The result should look something like this:
