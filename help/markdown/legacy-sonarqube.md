# Analyze your code with SonarQube

From the [web page](http://sonarqube.org):
"The SonarQubeÂ® platform is an open source quality management platform, dedicated to continuously analyzing and measuring the technical quality of source code, from project portfolio down to the method level"

It can analyze a lot of different programming languages, from PHP, Erlang, CSS to Cobol. C# can be installed
with an additional plugin. This must be done on the SonarQube server. 
To support the analysis process on a build server, an additional command line tool called "MSBuild.SonarQube.Runner.exe"
must be used. The SonarQube module in FAKE provides a function 'SonarQube' to call this tool with the needed parameters.

This function must be called twice, once at the beginning of the compilation process and once after
compilation has finished. The result is then collected and sent to the SonarQube server.


## Minimal working example

    Target "BeginSonarQube" (fun _ ->
      SonarQube Begin (fun p ->
        {p with
         Key = "MyProject"
         Name = "Main solution"
         Version = "1.0.0" }
        )
      )

    Target "EndSonarQube" (fun _ ->
      SonarQubeEnd()
    )

    Target "Default" DoNothing

    "Clean"
      ==> "SetAssemblyInfo"
      ==> "BeginSonarQube"
      ==> "Build" <=> "BuildTests"
      ==> "EndSonarQube"
      ==> "RunTests"
      ==> "Deploy"
      ==> "Default"

    RunTargetOrDefault "Default"

By default, the SonarQube module looks for the MSBuild runner in the 'tools/SonarQube' directory. This can be overwritten using the ToolsPath property of the parameters.

## Additional options for SonarQube

* You can send additional global settings  to the server with the '/d:' parameter.
In the SonarQubeParams, this is the new field Settings:

      SonarQube Begin (fun p ->
        {p with
         Key = "MyProject"
         Name = "Main solution"
         Version = "1.0.0" 
         Settings = ["sonar.debug"; "sonar.newversion"] }
        )

* Configuration can also be read from a configuration file. This is the '/s:' parameter.
This can be done with the new field Config:

      SonarQube Begin (fun p ->
        {p with
         Key = "MyProject"
         Name = "Main solution"
         Version = "1.0.0" 
         Config = Some("myconfig.cfg") }
        )
